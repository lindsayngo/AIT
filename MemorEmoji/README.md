A card game in which a deck of cards containing pairs of symbols are shuffled and laid face down on a surface. A player flips two cards over on each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. The player will have a limited number of turns to do this.

The interface has:
* a form that allows the user to set the number of cards, the maximum turns allowed, and (optionally) the order that the cards placed
* A game board of a grid of cards where all of the cards are initially face down (once clicked, they are flipped over), a count of the turns taken over the maximum number of turns, and a quit button (to restart the game)
