Homework #01 - Connectmoji

An interactive 2-player (computer vs human player) "connection" game.

*the game is played on a vertical grid of cells (imagine a board stood on its side)
*players take alternate turns dropping a piece in a column
*the piece dropped will occupy the lowest unoccupied cell of the grid
*when a player drops a piece that results in an uninterrupted vertical, horizontal or diagonal line of adjacent identical pieces of an agreed upon length, that player wins

for example, the board below shows that 😎 has won the game by creating a vertical line of four consecutive pieces in column C
|    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
|    |    | 😎 |    |    |    |    |
| 💻 |    | 😎 |    |    |    |    |
| 💻 | 😎 | 😎 |    | 💻 |    | 💻 |
| 😎 | 😎 | 😎 | 💻 | 💻 | 😎 | 💻 |
|----+----+----+----+----+----+----|
| A  | B  | C  | D  | E  | F  | G  |
(note that this game can be played to any length of consecutive pieces or any number of rows / columns)
