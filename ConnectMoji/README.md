An interactive 2-player (computer vs human player) "connection" game.

* the game is played on a vertical grid of cells (imagine a board stood on its side)
* players take alternate turns dropping a piece in a column
* the piece dropped will occupy the lowest unoccupied cell of the grid
* when a player drops a piece that results in an uninterrupted vertical, horizontal or diagonal line of adjacent identical pieces of an agreed upon length, that player wins (note that this game can be played to any length of consecutive pieces or any number of rows / columns)
